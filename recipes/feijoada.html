    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains the rich flavors
        famous in Brazil. Excellent served over brown rice. Additional meats, including pork loin or smoked sausage, may
        be added if desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chopped onion, divided</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>half cup green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
        <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
        <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
        <li>half pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon of coriander, ground</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir
            until softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce
            heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
        <li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion.</li>
        <li>Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Drain and add to beans. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer,
            uncovered, 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve onto a plate and enjoy!</li>
